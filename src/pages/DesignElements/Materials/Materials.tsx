        A brick base is probably one of the most common design elements of houses of that time, although there are also
        some examples using limestone(?) as a base. While concrete was heavily used in the construction of these houses,
        most of them were still built up using bricks, and as a design ethos the construction method should influence
        the appearance, therefore they were not covered up in some parts.

        To contrast with the smooth plaster surfaces, many buildings incorporated red exposed brickwork in specific
        areas. This was commonly seen:

      <ul>
        <li>In the base (Sockel) of the building, grounding the structure visually.</li>
        <li>As pilasters (Lisenen) to emphasize verticality.</li>
        <li>Around windows and door frames, adding depth and definition.</li>
      </ul>

        Plattenbauweise existed and was used in multiple examples, notably
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krochsiedlung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Krochsiedlung</a> in
        Leipzig.
        However, this type of construction was still more expensive than bricks, because labor was cheap.
