      <p>
        Facades were often brightly colored, with pastel tones dominating the palette. However, bolder shades were also
        used, creating a vibrant aesthetic. The most common facade finish was simple plaster, with
        &raquo;MÃ¼nchner Rauputz&laquo; (a rough-textured plaster) being a particularly popular choice.

        1920s facades often followed a strictly uniform design across all stories.
        Windows and decorative elements were usually aligned symmetrically.
        This emphasis on repetition and clarity reflected the ideals of the era: functionality, efficiency, and a rejection of overly ornate designs.
