            Welcome to the Portal of <i>Neues Bauen</i> &ndash; German for &raquo;New Building&laquo;,
            the modernist architecture movement around the 1920s in Germany
          </strong>

        <p>
          I started this little old-school hobby website to share my interest and fascination about the architecture
          of those buildings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have fun exploring the site and learning about Neues Bauen, and make sure to leave your own house in the guestbook!

      <h3>There will be more</h3>
      <p>
        I'll keep working on the website and add more content in the future.
