        <p>
          Welcome to the Portal of <i>Neues Bauen</i> &ndash; German for "New Building", the modernist architecture
          movement around the 1920s in Germany
        </p>

        <p>
          I started this little old-school hobby website to share my interest and fascination about the architecture
          of those buildings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Have fun exploring the site and learning about Neues Bauen, and make sure to leave your own house in the guestbook!
